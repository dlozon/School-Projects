# School-Projects

This repository contains several projects that I have made 
over the course of my stay at Kettering university. I intend 
for this repository to mostly serve as an archive. Not all of 
my projects will be here, but most of the major ones will be.

This includes code written in CS 101, CS 102, CS 203, and CS 231.

If any other students see this, feel free to use my projects 
as a reference if you are stuck, but please refrain from 
directly copying any code.
